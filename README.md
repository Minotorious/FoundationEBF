# FoundationEBF

A set of custom building functions for other mods to take advantage of! This mod is a dependency, it does nothing on its own!

You can find all building functions with their properties and usage instructions explained in detail in the [Community API](https://www.polymorph.games/foundation/modding/communityapi) documentation page. This mod also includes a set of example models to help you set up your own. To activate them in game simply uncomment the `EBF:dofile("scripts/Examples/registerExamples.lua")` line in the `mod.lua` file.

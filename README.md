# FoundationEBF

A set of custom building functions for other mods to take advantage of! This mod is a dependency, it does nothing on its own!

BUILDING_FUNCTION_DOUBLE_DOOR
BUILDING_FUNCTION_PORTCULLIS
BUILDING_FUNCTION_SIMPLE_DRAWBRIDGE

Resource Production

BUILDING_FUNCTION_PRODUCE_TREE (Coming Soon)

You can find all building functions with their properties and usage instructions explained in detail in the Community API documentation page. This mod also includes a set of example models to help you set up your own. To activate them in game simply uncomment the --EBF:dofile("scripts/examples.lua") line in the mod.lua file.
